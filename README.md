# UCoDe: Unified Community Detection with Graph Convolutional Networks

Implementation of UCoDe for overlapping and non-overlapping community detection as proposed in the paper:

This implementation is written in Python 3.

# Requirements
<ul>
  <li>networkx</li>
  <li>numpy</li>
  <li>pandas</li>
  <li>scikit-learn</li>
  <li>scipy</li>
  <li>torch==1.10.0</li>
</ul>

# Installation
    
You can install all the required packages using the following command:

$conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt

# Run the code

Run main.py for an example result of non-overlapping community detection.
<br>Run mainOUCODE.py for an example result of overlapping community detection.
